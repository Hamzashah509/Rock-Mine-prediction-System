# Mine vs. Rock Classification

This project utilizes a logistic regression model to classify underwater objects as either mines or rocks. The model was trained on a dataset containing acoustic signals and features. The main goal was to achieve accurate classification and provide an interactive prediction system.

## Features

- Implemented logistic regression using Python.
- Utilized NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn for data preprocessing and modeling.
- Achieved an accuracy of approximately 75% on the classification task.
- Visualized model performance using matplotlib's confusion matrix plot.
- Created an interactive system for users to predict object types based on input data.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the main script to train the model and interactively predict object types.

```bash
python main.py
